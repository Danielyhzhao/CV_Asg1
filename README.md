CDS540 Assignment 1: Text Detection from Images Using OpenCV

1.Overview

This repository contains the solution for the CDS540 Assignment 1, which involves detecting text from images using OpenCV. The assignment aims to provide hands-on experience with fundamental Computer Vision algorithms and techniques, and to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of computer vision systems.

2.Setup Environment

Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

OpenCV library installed

Any necessary libraries for image processing and OCR (e.g., Tesseract)

3.Task Description

Load an Image: Load a sample image containing text from various sources such as scanned documents, street signs, or any image with clear text.

Pre-process the Image: Convert the image to grayscale and apply image processing techniques to enhance text visibility.

Text Detection: Use OpenCV's text detection methods, such as the EAST text detector, to detect text areas and draw bounding boxes around them.

Extract and Display Text: Use OCR tools like Tesseract to extract text from the detected regions and display the extracted text along with the annotated image.

Efficiency and Effectiveness Evaluation: Measure the performance of the text detection system, discussing both efficiency (speed) and effectiveness (accuracy), and suggest potential improvements.

4.How to Use This Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequence.

Review the code and inline comments for explanations.

Run the text detection system on your own images to test its performance.
